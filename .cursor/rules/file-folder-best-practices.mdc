# Best Practices for Creating New Files and Folders

When creating new files and folders in this project, always follow these best practices to ensure consistency and compliance with linters and Prettier:

## File and Folder Naming
- Use **kebab-case** for file and folder names (e.g., `my-feature.ts`, `user-profile/`).
- Avoid spaces, special characters, or uppercase letters in names.
- Use descriptive names that reflect the file or folder's purpose.

## File Extensions and Placement
- Use `.ts` for TypeScript source files.
- Place test files alongside their source files, using the `.spec.ts` suffix (e.g., `my-feature.spec.ts`).
- Group related files in feature-based or domain-based folders for modularity.

## Formatting and Linting
- Run Prettier on all new files before committing: `npx prettier --write <filename>`
- Ensure all new files pass linting: `npx eslint <filename>`
- Use the project's Prettier and ESLint configuration files for formatting and linting rules.
- **All files must end with a blank line.**

## Imports and Exports
- Always add necessary imports and exports when creating new modules.
- Avoid circular dependencies by keeping modules decoupled.

## Folder Structure
- Organize code by domain or feature, not by type (e.g., prefer `account/handlers/` over `handlers/account/`).
- Keep folders small and focused; split large folders when they grow too complex.

## Documentation
- Update or create relevant documentation in the `docs/` directory when adding significant new features or modules.

## Review and Approval
- Before creating new files or folders, request a review as per workspace rules.

For more details, refer to the [package.json](mdc:package.json) for scripts and configuration, and the [README.md](mdc:README.md) for project guidelines.
