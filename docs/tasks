# CQRS Project Task List

## 1. Query Handlers for Account Retrieval
**User Story:**
As a system user, I want to retrieve account information using queries so that I can view account details and lists without modifying data.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Query interfaces for retrieving account(s) are defined.
- Query handlers return correct account data for valid queries.
- Query handlers handle non-existent accounts gracefully.
- All query handler logic is covered by unit tests.
- Query handlers are integrated with the query bus.
- Code is reviewed and passes all tests.
- Documentation is updated if needed.
- No breaking changes to existing features.
- All acceptance criteria are verified by tests or manual review.
- All tasks below are completed.
- [ ] Define query interfaces (e.g., GetAccountByIdQuery, ListAccountsQuery)
- [ ] Implement query handler classes
- [ ] Write unit tests for query handlers
- [ ] Integrate query handlers with the query bus

## 2. Event Publishing and Handling
**User Story:**
As a developer, I want the system to publish and handle domain events so that side effects and integrations can react to important changes in the system.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Domain events are defined for key actions (e.g., account creation).
- Events are published at appropriate points in command handlers.
- Event handlers process events and trigger side effects as needed.
- All event logic is covered by unit tests.
- Event publishing and handling does not break existing features.
- Code is reviewed and passes all tests.
- Documentation is updated if needed.
- All acceptance criteria are verified by tests or manual review.
- All tasks below are completed.
- [ ] Define domain events (e.g., AccountCreatedEvent)
- [ ] Publish events in command handlers
- [ ] Implement event handler classes
- [ ] Write unit tests for event handlers

## 3. Persistence Layer
**User Story:**
As a system user, I want account data to be persisted so that information is not lost between sessions and can be reliably retrieved.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Account repository interface is defined.
- At least one implementation (in-memory or database) is provided.
- Data persists across operations and can be retrieved by queries.
- Repository is integrated with command and query handlers.
- All repository logic is covered by tests.
- No data loss or corruption occurs during normal operations.
- Code is reviewed and passes all tests.
- Documentation is updated if needed.
- All acceptance criteria are verified by tests or manual review.
- All tasks below are completed.
- [ ] Design account repository interface
- [ ] Implement in-memory or database-backed repository
- [ ] Integrate repository with command and query handlers
- [ ] Write tests for repository logic

## 4. Validation and Error Handling
**User Story:**
As a system user, I want commands and queries to be validated and errors handled gracefully so that I receive clear feedback and the system remains robust.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Input validation is implemented for all commands and queries.
- Invalid input is rejected with clear, actionable error messages.
- Error handling does not expose sensitive information.
- All validation and error scenarios are covered by tests.
- System remains stable and robust under invalid input.
- Code is reviewed and passes all tests.
- Documentation is updated if needed.
- All acceptance criteria are verified by tests or manual review.
- All tasks below are completed.
- [ ] Add input validation for commands and queries
- [ ] Implement error handling and meaningful error messages
- [ ] Write tests for validation and error scenarios

## 5. API Layer
**User Story:**
As an API consumer, I want to interact with the system through a well-defined API so that I can perform operations and retrieve data programmatically.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API endpoints are defined for all major commands and queries.
- API returns correct responses for valid requests.
- API handles invalid requests with appropriate error messages.
- API is documented (OpenAPI/Swagger or similar).
- API is covered by integration tests.
- API is integrated with command and query buses.
- No breaking changes to existing features.
- Code is reviewed and passes all tests.
- All acceptance criteria are verified by tests or manual review.
- All tasks below are completed.
- [ ] Design REST or GraphQL API endpoints for commands and queries
- [ ] Implement controllers/routes
- [ ] Integrate API with command and query buses
- [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints
